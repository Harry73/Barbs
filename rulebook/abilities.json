Deal 6d8 lightning magic damage and 5d10 light magic damage to all enemies in a 35 ft square, centered on a space in range; this attack deals double damage and has 30% Lethality against entities of demonic origin. Allies, including yourself, that are caught in the blast will gain the lightning damage rolled as on-hit damage for their next attack and heal for the light damage rolled. This attack leaves behind a field of banishment; within this field, attacks against entities of demonic origin have 30% Lethality and all enemies have -20% MR and CR. The field lasts for 1 minute, but you may expend it as a free action, cleansing 1 condition on every ally, including yourself, that was within the field. You may cast this ability as a free action if you expend 2 Hunter stacks; if you do, this attack ignores MR, cannot be blocked, and bypasses magical barriers."

If you do, you absorb the spell being cast instead of releasing it. While a spell is absorbed in this manner, the next instance of damage you would take is negated (along with any negative effects associated with that damage), activating the absorbed spell in response and casting it on the damage's source, regardless of distance. When an absorbed spell is cast this way, it cannot be counterspelled.
