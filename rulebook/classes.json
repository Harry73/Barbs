All monk passives, along with whatever the class's specific passive is, also provide a level of monk mastery. Each level of monk mastery augments a character's dU and their base combo chance. The designation dU refers to the damage dice of an unarmed strike; for a non-monk character, this is a d4, but every additional monk mastery passive increases dU by one dice level, to d6, d8, d10, d12, and finally d20. Additionally, each level of monk mastery augments a character's base combo chance. Combo chance is the percentage chance that after casting a major action ability that has the combo tag that you will be able to follow up with another combo ability that has yet to be used that turn. Base combo chance for a non-monk is 0%, and increases with each monk mastery passive to 10%, 20%, 30%, 35%, and finally 40%. Abilities themselves can temporarily improve one's combo chance; the Martial Artist class provides a branch dedicated to monk related utilities such as this; on top of its single and multi target physical attacks with unarmed strikes, which scale off dU rather than having set damage.

Dual wielding bladed shields with specialized chain systems attached to their wristguards, the Sentinel has redefined the art of shield combat with innovative new techniques. Being able to double down on the defensive aspects of shields, the Sentinel also brings vicious new attacking opportunities and a wealth of utility and mobility. This class bides its time playing defensively in order to release energy in a burst of explosive movements and attacks in later rounds. The chains on his shields allow for easy shield tossing and dragging himself and opponents where he pleases, and opens up his effective range and target selection. While dual wielding is technically optional with this class, choosing to hold two shields maximizes the abilities this class provides. In order to help these specialized shields mesh with other classes, the Sentinel treats all shields that have implicit damage as axes, longblades, blunt weapons, and heavy throwing weapons as well. The default range for a Sentinel's shield chain is 30 ft, and can be picked up from range using the chains as a free action.",
