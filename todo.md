Ian's TODO list

* Poisoned is not an official condition, it should be.

* Make a button on the character sheet to test constructed items, to make sure everything looks good. 
    Normally we only log any errors, which isn't helpful to the common man. We should be able to print errors to
    chat.
* Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.
* Do rolls for combo chance automatically
