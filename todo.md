Ian's TODO list

* Burn is not an official condition, it should be.

* Roll psychic offensive automatically when an attack deals psychic damage
* add things that aren't actual stats to the character sheet somewhere
* AC pen is usually a percentage, not a raw number. Should adjust "take damage" accordingly.

* Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.
