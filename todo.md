Ian's TODO list

* API
    * abilities
        * Evangelist AC
    * don't apply buffs if they're already applied
    * give warning if you're over the buff limit
        * probably need to know what effects are actual buffs/enchants/empowers/none
    * button to check that item affixes are correct
    * Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.

* Website
  * a random gear generator with all the possible currently existing mods properly paired with the types of gear that they can legally be on
  * a random enemy generator with the rules that ill define once i finish the rules for that
