Ian's TODO list

* Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.

* abilities
    * Evangelist AC

* don't apply buffs if they're already applied
* give warning if you're over the buff limit
    * probably need to know what effects are actual buffs/enchants/empowers/none

* Website
  * a random gear generator with all the possible currently existing mods properly paired with the types of gear that they can legally be on
  * a random enemy generator with the rules that ill define once i finish the rules for that
