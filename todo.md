Ian's TODO list

* Poisoned is not an official condition, it should be.

* Documentation
    * The new buttons on the characteristics page
        * The fact that CR/AC/MR on the Stats pagea are the same as the ones on the characteristics page
    * Describe pure api somewhere, how you would use "!barbs <command>"
    * Constructing items

* Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.
* Do rolls for combo chance automatically
