Ian's TODO list

* Poisoned is not an official condition, it should be.

* Documentation
    * The new buttons on the characteristics page
        * The fact that CR/AC/MR on the Stats pagea are the same as the ones on the characteristics page
    * Describe pure api somewhere, how you would use "!barbs <command>"
    * Constructing items

* Figure out buff effectiveness from items automatically
* Do rolls for combo chance automatically

* Maybe put all handlers for item construction into one giant dictionary and then process them by longest keys 
  first. It could help prevent accidental duplicate keys.
