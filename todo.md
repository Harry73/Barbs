Ian's TODO list

* Nicer ability fetching
    * Replace classes and abilities lists in components.js with that.
    * Always fetch the ability info when an API call comes in and pass it on to the ability-specific method.

* Item handling
    * Make back-end processing for turning some json structure into a JS item.
    * Make front-end UI for creating an item.
    * Join the two, make some way to print out the item in human format and the item in API-JS format.

* Figure out buff effectiveness from items automatically
* Do rolls for combo chance automatically
