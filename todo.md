Ian's TODO list

* Poisoned is not an official condition, it should be.

* Everyone's items have been converted to constructions.
    * Remove "construct" prefix altogether (we're in migration mode currently where it's not strictly required)

* Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.
