Ian's TODO list

* Poisoned is not an official condition, it should be.

* Everyone's items have been converted to constructions.
    * Remove "construct" prefix from items, update API and sheet workers accordingly
    * Trash the master items list
* Check Weapon Mastery Shields at rank 1 and apply damage increase automatically
* Make persistent effects survive an API restart, since it's actually decently easy to see and remove them now.
